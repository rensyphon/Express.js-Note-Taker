# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description

This project involved refactoring code to create a note taker. The end product will take inputs for a title and text, then save the note for later retrieval. This project was built using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Express.js. Another requirement was uuid, to provide IDs to each note.


## Installation

This program may also be forked from [Github](https://github.com/rensyphon/PWA-Text-Editor), then installed by running `npm i` and `npm start` in a source code editor terminal.

The program may also be used live at [Heroku]().

## Usage

From the homepage, click "Get Started." After this, you will be taken to a page where you can enter a title and text content for a note. To save this, click the save icon in the top right. Saved notes will appear in the sidebar on the left. You can view them by clicking on them. While viewing an old note, click on the plus icon in the top right to be able to add a new note again.
